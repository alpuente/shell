This is a UNIX shell written in C for my operating systems course. 
To compile the shell, just use "gcc shell.c". 
Run the shell normally, (./a.exe).
You'll be prompted by "osh>" and at that point can enter basic UNIX commands. 
The UNIX command will be executed by a child thread, while the parent thread waits for the command to execute. If you don't want the parent thread to wait, enter the command followed by an ampersand (i.e. "ls &").
